        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5%;">COVerage is an AI powered news application that compiles local news regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. 
        Information ranging from local outbreak news to school closures/updates is analyzed by our natural language processing AI and is summarized and ranked. </h3>

        <p style="margin-top: 5%;">COVerage was made to take a user's location and get the latest news from local outlets about how the COVID-19 pandemic
        is affecting the community. We show news by breaking it down into five categories: Policy changes (local laws/curfews), Finance, Vaccine progress, 
        Education, and Statistics/Spread rates. </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 5%;">As a contributor to this project, I managed the development and wrote thousands of lines of code. I also co-created the algorithm we
        use to rank our search results. I first-authored our <a href="https://theinformaticists.com/2020/08/25/coverage-region-specific-sars-cov-2-news-query-algorithm/">paper</a>.
        Our team presented this as a talk to the Stanford Electrical Engineering faculty in Summer of 2020. My team and I initially started COVerage as a response to the lack of 
        up to date and reliable news for how COVID-19 was affecting our commnunities. Whether we were looking at the number of cases in our county or how our local grocery stores are affected, 
        we couldn't find a solid way to view everything at once. This is why we created COVerage. </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 5%;">A cool feature of COVerage that we got a chance to implement is news from around the world. For example, if a user is looking at COVerage's Interface
            from Tokyo, Japan, then COVerage will show news in Japanese and will show news from local Tokyo news.

        <p style="margin-top: 5%;"> My team's involvement with this project was through the <a href="https://compression.stanford.edu/summer-internships-high-school-students">STEM2SHTEM Stanford Compression Forum Internship program</a>. 
        After the program ended, our team met with some professors within the Electrical Engineering Department to discuss continuing our research into Fall. 
        We then had the opportunity to talk about our project with <a href="https://journalism.stanford.edu">Stanford_Journalism</a>. This project was my introduction
        to computer science research. </p>
